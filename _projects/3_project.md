There has been so many advances within the digital AI music age, with models such as ... and .... bringing about possibilities in music creation that weren't there a few years ago.

A major project that I have been working on is getting composers involved in the process, and getting their voices heard as a new set of AI music composition tools start to hit the market.

Working alongside a small group of composers, I conducted a Design Ethnography of their approaches to composing, collecting data on their workflow, individual methodologies and uses of software and hardware. The aim was to provide a reference for researchers or those designing musical interfaces for composition, with the hope that it would inspire new approaches and designs.
