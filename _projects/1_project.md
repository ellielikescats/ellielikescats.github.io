As part of my PhD research into the use of generative music models with music composition, I worked alongside my friend and fellow researcher Jingjing Tang at C4DM, QMUL to develop a dataset where we could explore generating variations with a transformer model.

The dataset is available to download here: [text](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11264676).

Since the publication of the dataset, I have been working towards benchmarking this data for the Music Overpainting task. A paper presenting a baseline for the task was recently accepted to the AES International Symposium on AI and the Musician.

Stay tuned for the official implementation, and newer generations of variations!
