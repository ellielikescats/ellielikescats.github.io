I am a PhD researcher supervised by Dr. George Fazekas and Prof. Simon Dixon within the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) at Queen Mary University of London. I research the applications of machine learning in music and audio with a focus on music generation.

Currently, my research centres around the implementation of deep learning models for tasks in music composition, such as music inpainting, overpainting and style transfer.

As a composer and musician, my research is entwined with my love of music. I am developing AI tools to extend and enhance creativity in music composition and production, in collaboration with a group of professional composers from diverse backgrounds around the world.
